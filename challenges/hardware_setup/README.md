## Hardware Test Files

These programs can be used to test the hardware. 
A short video with assembly instructions for the ESC hardware is available [here](https://tinyurl.com/Microelectronics2025-assembly).

All components were tested before shipping. A few extra components were provided in case of electrostatic discharge issue.

### Speaker Mic Test

In this test, the speaker will play a series of test frequencies to be detected by the microphone. The test results will be printed out on the serial port.
After the microphone test, the keypad can be tested by pressing the keys. Output will be printed out on the seven-segment display and over the serial port.

**Note:** The potentiometer may need to be adjusted on the microphone breakout board for more gain (clockwise).

### Vibration Relay Test

This test will test the vibrator and relay. You should hear the vibrator pulse several times, followed by several relay clicks. This will repeat over varying frequencies.
