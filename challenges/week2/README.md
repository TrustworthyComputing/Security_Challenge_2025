Welcome to Week 2!! This week we have two new challenges that will require some out of the box thinking and creative solutions. Can you decode these messages, and manipulate them to reveal the flags? 

## Mission: Escape from Cottonland

You entered a world of joy: rainbow-striped conveyor belts, polka-dotted machines whirring in harmony, and the famous Tap-Dancing Sock Mascots, twirling endlessly with stitched-on grins. Rooms shimmered with socky delight, each filled with fluff, funk, and the faint scent of fresh cotton. But suddenly… the music changed. What began as a gleeful romp through the Happy Sock Puppet Factory — a kaleidoscope of color, laughter, and toe-tapping textile magic — has taken a curiously twisted turn. 

Doors slammed shut. Lights dimmed to a flickering glow. The cheerful mascots still dance — but now with a mechanical precision, their smiles strangely... too wide. The giggles echo. But they don’t stop. You're locked in. But there is an opportunity for *re*-morse. In the center of the room sits a glittery, dust-covered contraption: the legendary Happy Tap Dancing Socks Message Machine 2000. It clanks to life, spewing out bizarre rhythmic pulses and sock-patterned code. Whatever it’s saying, it’s urgent. To escape this sock-swirled madhouse, you'll need to hijack the line and send a distress signal — before the mascots start toe-ing the line. Time to put your best foot forward.


## Mission: NUVxVTNuQzM

A string of symbols, "seemingly" meaningless — NUVxVTNuQzM. But within this cryptic *base* lies the key to unraveling a *64*-bit digital riddle.

As numbers whirl in a rhythmic storm, only those who can attune themselves to the pulse of the code will uncover its secret. This is no ordinary puzzle — it’s a symphony of speed, structure, and silence.

Can you decode the harmony within the chaos and reveal the hidden message before the final note fades?
