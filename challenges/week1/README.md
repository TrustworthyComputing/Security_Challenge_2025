Welcome to Week 1 challenges! Prepare for a thrilling and intellectually stimulating journey. You will dive deep into the realm of embedded cyber-physical systems cybersecurity as you continue to hone your hacking skills, navigate through intricate systems to unearth vulnerabilities, and claim those highly sought-after flags.

The challenges focus on leaking sound based side channels. The sounds emitted by the electromechanical devices will leak information about the flag. Sound recordings may be helpful to solve these challenges.

Each of the prompts contain hints as to approach the challenge. Be sure to read them carefully and see if anything stands out!! 

## Mission: Bluebox

Deep within a hidden underground bunker, your team stumbles upon a relic of hacker history — the fabled Blue Box device. Once used by early phreakers to manipulate telephone networks, this piece of tech holds secrets long thought lost.

To unlock the mysteries of the lair, you must decode a series of classic telephone frequencies and reconstruct the precise audio tones that once controlled the phone system. Only by mastering this frequency art can you reveal the hidden flag.

Time is running out — the authorities are closing in. Can you resurrect this legendary hack before your signal goes dead?

**NOTE: Binary was updated (v2) with added hints and new flag.**

You roll up to the chrome beast — a vending machine humming like a fine-tuned street rod, promising sugar, salt, and satisfaction. Behind its glass panel, snacks shimmer in bright wrappers: chips that crunch like gravel under tires, chocolate bars revved and ready to melt in your mouth.

You’ve got coins in your palm, jingling like tools in a mechanic’s belt. You're ready to drop ‘em in, fire up the gears, and ride this snack machine straight to Flavor Town. But then... you hesitate.

What if there's a way to game the system? A glitch. A loophole. A sweet detour to greatness. If you can time it just right — trigger an error mid-dispense — maybe you can grab your treat and get your money back. No crime, just finesse. (OK, maybe a little crime). A snack heist with mechanical flair.

Can you pump the brakes at just the right moment, stall the system, and roll off with your prize like a polished wrench in the night? Strap in, snack thief. It's time for a high-carb treat run.
