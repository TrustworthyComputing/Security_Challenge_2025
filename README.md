# Microelectronics Security Competition 2025 — Overview

We’re excited to announce the launch of Microelectronics Security Competition 2025, an educational and competitive event that dives deep into the world of hardware, microelectronics and cybersecurity! This year’s challenge is proudly organized by the University of Delaware, under the guidance of Professor Nektarios Tsoutsos and Lars Folkerts.

This competition focuses on the high school track that covers basic side-channel attacks to cyberphysical systems. 

Over the course of 6 weeks, three sets of challenges will be released. Solving a challenge will reveal a flag, which will resemble a encoded string (e.g. tH!s1sAF!4g). Partial points can be awarded for certain challenges. If some aspects of the competition appear challenging, we can publish a set of hints that can be requested over email (tsoutsos@udel.edu).

A final PDF report will be due on **August 20th**. The report should include a brief description of your setup and tools that you used, a brief overview of the challenges and a detailed account of how you solved the challenges. The report can also provide details about the recovered challenge flags and sample inputs used to get the flag.

## Challenge Summary

The Microelectronics Security Competition 2025 will focus on Side Channel Attacks (SCAs) targeting Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). CPS are essential components in industries ranging from manufacturing to critical infrastructure - but even when protected by strong cryptography, improper configurations can leave them vulnerable to subtle side-channel leaks.

In this year’s challenge, participants are invited to analyze SCAs on Arduino Uno-based CPS platforms, each running different firmware versions that expose various side channels. Several challenges focus on audio side channels, where sounds produced by electromechanical devices leak secrets to the user. These signals may need to be recorded and analyzed to solve the challenge. Participants will identify and exploit these channels and are welcome to discuss real-world mitigations.
